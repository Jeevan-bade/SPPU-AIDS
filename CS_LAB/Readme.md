# üîê Cyber Security Mini Projects - Part A

This repository contains implementations of five foundational cryptographic algorithms as part of the **Cyber Security Mini Project** (Savitribai Phule Pune University, TY B.Tech - AI & DS). Each assignment demonstrates core concepts in both **symmetric** and **asymmetric** cryptography.

## üìå Assignments Included

1. **S-DES (Simplified Data Encryption Standard)**
2. **S-AES (Simplified Advanced Encryption Standard)**
3. **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange**
4. **RSA Algorithm**
5. **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)**

## üîçOverview

| Assignment | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| S-DES | Symmetric | A reduced complexity version of DES used for educational purposes. |
| S-AES | Symmetric | A simplified version of AES that works on smaller block sizes. |
| Diffie-Hellman | Key Exchange | Enables two parties to generate a shared secret over an insecure channel. |
| RSA | Asymmetric | Public key encryption using the mathematical properties of large primes. |
| ECC | Asymmetric | Public key cryptography based on elliptic curves for better security with smaller keys. |
